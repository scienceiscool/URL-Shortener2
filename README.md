#CPSC 473 - Web Programming & Data Management
##URL Shortener 2

__Prompt:__ Rewrite portions of your URL shortener from Assignment 7 to use MongoDB instead of Redis. You may use either Mongoose or the standard MongoDB API.

_Tips:_<br>
- The difficulty of this assignment will depend on whether you successfully completed the previous assignment and how well you designed your solution
- Consider using a MongoDB capped collection for the top-ten list
- You may find that MongoDB is particularly well-suited to creating Web Service API-style applications. If you created a more traditional dynamically-generated HTML application for the previous assignment, consider alternative designs.
